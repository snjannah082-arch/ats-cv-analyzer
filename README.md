3. Implement real file parsing (PDF.js, mammoth.js)
4. Add proper error handling and validation

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

### Other Platforms
The app can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js:
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- Railway
- DigitalOcean App Platform

## üìä Data Storage

Currently uses localStorage for demo purposes. For production:

1. **Database Integration**: Add your preferred database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
2. **File Storage**: Integrate with cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
3. **Authentication**: Add user authentication and authorization
4. **API Routes**: Create proper API endpoints for data management

## üéØ Future Enhancements

- **Real AI Integration**: Connect to OpenAI or other AI services
